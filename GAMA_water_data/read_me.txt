The US EPA has established a lifetime Health Advisory Level (HAL) for PFOA and PFOS of
70 ng/L. When both PFOA and PFOS are found in drinking water, the combined
concentrations of PFOA and PFOS should be compared with the 70 ng/L HAL.
The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) adopted the US EPA HAL of 70 ng/L as
the California Response Level (RL). The SWRCB also established Notification Levels (NL) of
5.1 ng/L for PFOA and 6.5 ng/L for PFOS. When the NLs are exceeded, the Division of
Drinking Water (DDW) recommends that the source be removed from service and treated.
When the RL is exceeded, and concentrations cannot be reduced below the US EPA HAL,
DDW recommends removing the source from service.

Several states have groundwater quality regulations for PFOA. In West Virginia and Ohio,
residents must be provided alternative drinking water when PFOA levels exceed 70 ng/L.
Minnesota has adopted a Chronic Health Risk Limit of 300 ng/L for PFOA and PFOS in
drinking water. In 2018, New Jersey recommended a health-based Maximum Contaminant
Level (MCL) of 13 ng/L for PFOS, 14 ng/L for PFOA, and adopted an MCL for PFNA of 13
ng/L in drinking water.
